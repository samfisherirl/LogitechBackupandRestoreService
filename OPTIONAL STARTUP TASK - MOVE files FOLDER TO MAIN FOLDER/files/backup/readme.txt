dont move app from folder before you have installed.

Extract, open and select install. Use from same window or desktop app. Then you can move anywhere you like.

This saves and restores LGHUB settings, profiles, macros, and scripts with the option to schedule startup windows task.

Install gets sent to C:\programdata\

Backup gets sent to C:\programdata\LogitechBackup\

Restore overwrites data in C:\programdata\LGHUB

if you want a startup task to backup files every time you boot windows, download optional folder from github. 
move the 'files' folder into the main folder with app to allow the program to create a startup task. 

or move 
'create startup task.exe'
to /files/backup/
