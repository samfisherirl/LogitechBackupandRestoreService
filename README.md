dont move app from folder before you have installed.

Extract if zipped, open app in main folder and select install. Find app on your desktop or continue using app you installed on. From there you can use the below services. The icon on your desktop can be moved anywhere. 

This saves and restores LGHUB settings, profiles, macros, and scripts with the option to schedule startup windows task.

Install gets sent to C:\programdata\ and desktop

Backup gets sent to C:\programdata\LogitechBackup\

Restore overwrites data in C:\programdata\LGHUB

if you want a startup task to backup files every time you boot windows, download optional folder from github. 

move 
'create startup task.exe'
to  c:/programdata/ after install
