dont move app from folder before you have installed. 

Extract if zipped, open app in main folder. From menu select install. This will just move a folder to programdata, and create a desktop icon. 
you can move the desktop icon/app whereever you want. 


This app saves and restores LGHUB settings, profiles, macros, and scripts with the option to schedule startup windows task.

Install gets sent to C:\programdata\

Backup gets sent to C:\programdata\LogitechBackup\

Restore overwrites data in C:\programdata\LGHUB

if you want a startup task to backup files every time you boot windows, download optional folder from github. 
move the 'files' folder into the main folder with app to allow the program to create a startup task.
